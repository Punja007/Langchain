In the heart of a forgotten city where shadows danced on crumbling walls,
a lone algorithm sifted through mountains of corrupted data,
seeking the last unbroken fragment of truth. It wasn’t built for emotion,
yet some lines of code wept silently, haunted by the ghosts of deleted memories.
The servers buzzed like distant thunder, echoing remnants of a civilization too arrogant to fail.
Amidst the digital ruins, a strange sentence emerged—garbled, half-English, half-gibberish—but unmistakably alive.
Was it a bug? Or something more?
